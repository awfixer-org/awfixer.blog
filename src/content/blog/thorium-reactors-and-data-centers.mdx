title: Thorium Reactors and Data Centers
---

#### This is the first in a series of posts about our endeavor to build a Thorium Reactor Powered Data Center, and even multible for AWFixer Industries

### There are a few main struggles to building a data-center

##### one of them is the amount of power that a data center needs, which is both expensive, and often is hard to obtain. So we have been thinking about a creative way to work around this

***

#### Support the beginnings on the idea using either [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/awfixer) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/awfixer)
